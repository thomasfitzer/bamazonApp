# Bamazon App
The main point of this app is to create a node application that allow a user to purchase products.

## Sections of the App
The main section of the app lists all of the products available for sale, then asks the user
which product they would like to purchase, and how many of that product. If there is enough in stock,
it displays the total cost and how many are now left. If there isn't enough left, it informs the user, 
and asks if they would like to purchase another product. Everything worked like a charm up until this 
point, when no matter which option they selected, it would end the process.

The mySQL part was easy as pie for me, the first time in this whole program that seemed to happen. The 
table lists the product ID number, along with the name of the product, the department it is in, the price,
and how many are left. Connecting it to the JS seemed to go easy enough.

## My Process
The first thing I did was create the table with all of the products, which was made easier by referencing 
work that we had done recently in class. Connecting it to the 
JS also wasn't too much of a hassle, and then came the code to pull the information out of the table.

Referencing the work we did in pulling the data out of the table with the "1000 Songs" work proved immeaurably helpful, as it was easy to extrapolate which process I should use to do this function.

## Conclusion
I can see where this actually app wouldn't be useful to a generic user out in the real world, but combining this code with a front end face would easily be able to allow a user to purchase a product.
